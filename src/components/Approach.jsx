            Institutional investors, emerging market entrepreneurs, and
            multinationals, are often skeptical about seeking new ventures in
            lesser-known markets. MURUNGA CAPITAL GROUP, LLC combines the
            diverse perspectives of macroeconomic, finance, strategy, and legal
            experts to reduce the perceived risks of doing business in Africa.
            As seasoned global experts, we leverage the human and financial
            capital to fill the various institutional voids to drive growth in
            the region. We succeed because we look at Economic Development
            through a 360 lens of Charity, Programs and Entrepreneurship.
